🧠 Interactive Quiz Game

A simple, interactive web-based quiz game built with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. Test your knowledge with multiple-choice questions, track your progress, and get a final score based on your performance!

✨ Features

Interactive UI: Smooth transitions between the start screen, the quiz itself, and the results screen.

Dynamic Content: Questions and answers are generated dynamically using JavaScript.

Instant Feedback: Buttons highlight green for correct answers and red for incorrect ones immediately after clicking.

Progress Tracking: A visual progress bar and a question counter keep you updated on how far along you are.

Custom Results: At the end of the quiz, players receive a final score and a custom message based on their percentage (e.g., "Perfect! You're a genius!", "Great Job! You know your stuff!").

Responsive Design: The layout is fully responsive and looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.

🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML5: Provides the structural foundation of the application.

CSS3: Handles the styling, layout, animations, and responsive design (using media queries).

JavaScript (ES6): Powers the game logic, DOM manipulation, event handling, and score calculation.
